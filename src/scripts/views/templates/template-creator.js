        But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and
        praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and
        expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder
        of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it
        is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally
        encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who
        loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but
        because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some
        great pleasure.
